#  Credit Card Default Risk Prediction

This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict the likelihood of credit card default based on customer transaction and account history data.

---

##  Overview

The goal of this project is to identify high-risk credit card customers using financial, historical, and behavioral data. It includes:
- Comprehensive data cleaning & transformation
- Feature engineering and missing value imputation
- Model building with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model evaluation using **AUROC** as the primary scoring metric

---

##  Workflow

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Date differences calculated from transaction timestamps
- Binarization of categorical indicators (e.g. account activity/status)
- Mean/mode imputation for missing data
- Encoding of string values into numerical features
- Automated filling of structured and semi-structured fields

 Full cleaning pipeline available in `data_cleaning.ipynb`

### 2. **Modeling Pipeline**
- `ColumnTransformer` for Yeo-Johnson power transforms
- Feature selection via `SelectFromModel` using Random Forest
- GridSearchCV used to tune:
  - Logistic Regression (`penalty`, `C`, `class_weight`)
  - Random Forest (`n_estimators`, `max_depth`)
  - XGBoost (`learning_rate`, `n_estimators`, `max_depth`)
- Evaluation with 5-fold cross-validation (AUROC scoring)

---

##  Results

| Model              | Best AUROC Score |
|-------------------|------------------|
| XGBoostClassifier | 0.8231 |
| RandomForestClassifier | 0.8211 |
| LogisticRegression | 0.8026 |

 **XGBoost** consistently ranked highest based on AUROC in cross-validation.
